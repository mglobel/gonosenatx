      Hapkido
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hapkido is a powerful and innovative Korean martial art.  Literally translated, the word Hap means “coordination” or “harmony”, Ki denotes the “essence of power”, and Do means “the art” or “the way”.  Therefore, the definition of Hapkido is “The Art of Coordinated Power”. Hapkido employs powerful kicking techniques similar to Korean Tae Kwon Do, throwing techniques like Japanese Aikido and Jujitsu, and hand techniques like Chinese Kenpo.  It is concise and practical, the result of a 1,300 year pursuit of the ultimate lifestyle.

    <h3>
      What to expect
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hapkido classes are rigorous and focus on both physical conditioning and learning new techniques. Class begins and ends with a meditation. After the meditation, the instructor will lead a warmup that involves stretching, core conditioning, and technique drills. Typically after the warm-up students break off into pairs to work on techniques for their belt test, but the instructor may choose to spend extra class time on specific kicks, techniques, tumbling, or conditioning. Devise at all times!

      Jiu-Jitsu
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jiu-jitsu arts focus on throwing, pinning, and joint-locking techniques to overcome a more powerful and bigger opponent. In the 1900s, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu developed, primarily from the early Jiu-jitsu and Judo. The Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu art focuses on continued ground grappling and has developed a body of techniques that makes it unique from traditional Japanese Jiu-Jitsu and Judo.

    <h3>
      What to expect
    </h3>
    <p>
      Jiu-jitsu classes focus on ground training and conditioning. We teach Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, No-Gi Jiu-Jitsu, Sport Jiu-Jitsu and Self-Defense Jiu-Jitsu. Classes cover Jiu-Jitsu grappling, throwing, and submission techniques and a healthy amount of live practice with rolling. Rolling allows the practicioner to work on techniques and apply them in a resistant, but safe, setting.
