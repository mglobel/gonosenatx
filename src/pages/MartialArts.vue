    <h2>
      Hapkido
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hapkido is a powerful and innovative Korean martial art.  Literally translated, the word Hap means “coordination” or “harmony”, Ki denotes the “essence of power”, and Do means “the art” or “the way”.  Therefore, the definition of Hapkido is “The Art of Coordinated Power”. Hapkido employs powerful kicking techniques similar to Korean Tae Kwon Do, throwing techniques like Japanese Aikido and Jujitsu, and hand techniques like Chinese Kenpo.  It is concise and practical, the result of a 1,300 year pursuit of the ultimate lifestyle. Go No Sen's' Hapkido Program is one of the finest in Texas. Taught by Head Instructor, Jon Michael Davis.

      Jiu-Jitsu
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jiu-jitsu has a wide a varied, history. It can be traced back thousand. Almost all jiu-jitsu forms focus on throwing, pinning, and joint-locking techniques to overcome a more powerful and bigger opponent. In the 1900s, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu developed, primarily from the Judo and Judo Nawez. The Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu art focuses on continued ground grappling and has developed a body of techniques that makes it unique from traditional Japanese Jiu-Jitsu and Judo.

      Jiu-jitsu classes focus on ground training and conditioning. We teach Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, No-Gi Jiu-Jitsu, Sport Jiu-Jitsu and Self-Defense Jiu-Jitsu. Classes cover Jiu-Jitsu grappling, throwing, and submission techniques and a healthy amount of live practice with rolling. The focus of rolling is to work on techniques and apply them in a resistant setting. Mr. Blackmon has a paragraph, that could be great here.
